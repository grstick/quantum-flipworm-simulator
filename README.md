# quantum-flipworm-simulator
A mathematically absurd simulation of a black hole performing advanced spatial maneuvers within a dark matter vortex. For science. Possibly.

# ðŸŒ€ Black Hole Trickshot Simulator

> A mathematically absurd simulation of a black hole performing a no-scope, 360-degree, no-look, no-hands, flame-throwing backflip into a dark matter vortex. Created for science, memes, and the pursuit of alternate dimensions.

## ðŸŒŒ About the Project

This Python script simulates a hypothetical black hole maneuvering through spacetime with extreme style. Combining spin velocity, flame propulsion, quantum randomness, and goblin-calibrated physics, the simulation outputs a dramatic (and occasionally reality-shattering) sequence of events leading into a wormhole vortex.

While the simulation is entirely tongue-in-cheek, it demonstrates:
- Basic use of math functions (`math.sin`, `sum`, etc)
- Randomized outcomes
- Looping, conditionals, and formatted strings
- How far nonsense can go when delivered confidently

## ðŸ§ª Use Cases

- Teaching chaos theory to children
- Stress testing AI alignment models
- Getting noticed by Elon Musk
- Cosmic ritual prep
- Mental cooldown between Rocket League losses

## ðŸš€ Run the Simulation

Clone the repo or copy the code into your Python environment:

```bash
